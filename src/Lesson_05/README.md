## Control Flow in C++

`continue` , `break` , and `return` is used for controlling the flow of the program.

### Continue

continue is used to skip current iteration in a loop.

### Break

break is used to end the loop even if the exit condition is not satisfied.

### Return

return is used to leave the function back to the return address with or without a value.
